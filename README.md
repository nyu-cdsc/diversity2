This application (under construction) will be used to run study examining children's diversity-based reasoning. 

Running the app for the first time: 
  Step 1: Download application. In this example, I am assuming you save the folder to the Desktop.
  Step 2: Open the command prompt. Using the command prompt, get into the application folder by typing: cd Desktop/diversity2-master
  Step 3: In the command prompt, type: npm install  (the computer will proceed to install a bunch of things. This make take a minute)

  When done with these steps, move to Step 2 of the following set of instructions.

Running the app every time after: 
  Step 1. Open the command prompt. Using the command prompt, get into the application folder by typing: cd Desktop/diversity2-master
  Step 2: Next, in the command prompt, type: ng serve --prod --aot 
  Step 3: Open Google Chrome. 
  Step 4: In Chrome, type: localhost:4200
  Step 5: Put Chrome into full screen mode (Fn + F11)
  Step 6: If using the surface gos, detach keyboard. Now kids are ready to play!! 

To restart the game (e.g., if kid walks away), double click “Start over” button on the bottom right of the screen. To export the data, double click “Export CSV” button on bottom left of screen. This file will need to be cleaned up a tad in R.
